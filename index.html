  From nowhere he came<br>
  To turn the page<br>
  From love and care, the bloodlust was made<br>
  Lips sewn shut, but can't tell you why
</p>
<p>
  Maybe someday you'll understand<br>
  Secret city of flames shouts his name<br>
  Was built with stone but soon to be ash<br>
  Creator of life cries before
</p>
<p>After infinite years of sorrow</p>
<p>Cry!</p>
<p>
  Lie, close your eyes and think<br>
  Find, in sea of heads you sink<br>
  Cry, tears will never dry<br>
  Die, in your endless dream
</p>
<p>Die!</p>
<p>
  Leave this place<br>
  Take what you hold dear<br>
  Leave this place<br>
  Make your own new home
</p>
<p>
  Climb so high to claim your dreams<br>
  Made it to the top, how hollow it feels
</p>
<p>
  Now fall down, go back to reality<br>
  Accept your faith, what's left of the sanity<br>
  Sold your head, for price of agony<br>
  Suffer for eternity, mistakes of nobody<br>
  Take a last look and close the door<br>
  Mourn it's death some more and more<br>
  You have burned your world and memories<br>
  Flashback of life leaves echo to remember
</p>
<p>Bring back the life</p>
<p>Roots of light, destroyed by endless time</p>
<p>
  Lie, close your eyes and think<br>
  Find, in sea of heads you sink<br>
  Cry, tears will never dry<br>
  Die, in your endless dream<br>
  Learned all the hate, bringing the piece together<br>
  Now it's too late, facing your doom forever
</p>
<p>
  Leave this place<br>
  Take what you hold dear<br>
  Leave this place<br>
  Fly away for forever
</p>
<p>
  From nowhere he came<br>
  To turn the page<br>
  From love and care, the bloodlust was made<br>
  Lips sewn shut, secrets of the art
</p>
<p>
  Maybe now you'll understand<br>
  Secret city of dust howled his name<br>
  Was built with stone but now to be ash<br>
  Creator of life cries before

        <summary>3. Slaying the Air</summary>
        <p>
  Through fog I come, blinded by ozone<br>
  Searching for the light, hiding in disguise<br>
  Lost in my mind, the peace I will never find<br>
  Pressing on forward, lost in this cycle forever
</p>
<p>
  I can feel the devastation in the air<br>
  My camouflage loses its power
</p>
<p>
  The clear image unstable, I crab the cloak<br>
  And hide within, all I want is just peace and quiet<br>
  To have my own place to be<br>
  Everything that promised to me, were a fuckin' lie
</p>
<p>
  Die, I’m sending you back to hell<br>
  Die, I've done it all again
</p>
<p>
  Give it back to me<br>
  Give me power that I own<br>
  Those things that belong to me<br>
  Or I am going to take your last drop of blood<br>
  From flesh to bones<br>
  From bone to ash<br>
  From ash to air<br>
  I'm slaying the air
</p>
<p>
  Slaying the air<br>
  Forced to fight<br>
  Slaying the air<br>
  Lost in the dark
</p>
<p>
  I’m slaying the air, the better life<br>
  Drop of blood lost in the night<br>
  Fight and fight until it dies
</p>
<p>
  It takes some time, to overcome our greatest fears<br>
  Cry of the wicked hurts my ears<br>
  Found the right spot, the ghost is there<br>
  Getting now close, the end is near
</p>
<p>
  Can you bear my thoughts?<br>
  Can you shield my wound?<br>
  Can you ease my pain?<br>
  Can you take my life?
</p>
<p>Yes that you can</p>
<p>Die, Die!</p>

        <summary>4. War of Eternity</summary>
        <p>
  Unleash the chaos<br>
  Raise the siren to alarm us<br>
  It’s time to fight<br>
  Until we die<br>
  Don't believe what you see<br>
  Hear what you want to hear<br>
  Countdown of our time<br>
  Raise your fist to the sky
</p>
<p>Can you see it’s the war of eternity!</p>
<p>
  Burn down your hopes<br>
  Discard all your thoughts<br>
  What's right or wrong<br>
  There's no answer to it all<br>
  Protect what’s yours<br>
  Hide the world from those<br>
  Who feel the pain of our foes<br>
  It’s their burning ground
</p>
<p>Fight until your last drop of blood!</p>
<p>
  Take your first shot<br>
  Destroy all they've got<br>
  Protect what's yours<br>
  Make it up for time lost<br>
  Strike the enemy's heart<br>
  Let it drain in mud<br>
  Sacrifice their lives<br>
  For belief not on your mind
</p>
<p>Do not stop until you have no breath in you!</p>
<p>
  Cut down their heads<br>
  Slice at their legs<br>
  Puncture through the artery<br>
  But that's not enough butchery<br>
  Prisoners of war align<br>
  Torture them alive<br>
  What's yours is mine<br>
  Enjoy the ride of your life
</p>
<p>We serve the light to live in the dark!</p>
<p>
  Gather all your power<br>
  Feed on your hate<br>
  Down they fall<br>
  Like crust down the hall
</p>
<p>
  Take your last shot<br>
  Aim with eyes shut<br>
  Protect what's yours<br>
  Take your last shot
</p>
<p>
  Through thorns and mud<br>
  I could have never known<br>
  At the precipice of dawn<br>
  My mouth is filled with tar<br>
  Gunpowder at dusk<br>
  It feels so unjust<br>
  Attack me if you must<br>
  Before I crumble
</p>
<p>... to dust</p>
<p>
  Show no hesitation<br>
  Gather all your hate<br>
  We got the war to win<br>
  For our patronage of sin
</p>
<p>
  Strike the enemy's heart<br>
  Let it drain in mud<br>
  Sacrifice their lives<br>
  For belief not on your mind<br>
  Don't believe what you see<br>
  Hear what you want to hear<br>
  Countdown of our time<br>
  Raise your fist to the sky
</p>
<p>Fight until your last drop of blood!</p>
<p>
  Alert and on your toes<br>
  Discard all your thoughts<br>
  What's right or wrong<br>
  There's no rules in war<br>
  Protect what’s yours<br>
  Bullets in the rain<br>
  Protect what's yours<br>
  By inflicting more pain
</p>
<p>Can you see it’s the war of eternity!</p>

        <summary>5. A Flick of Spark</summary>
        <p>
  Modest, yet plentiful, was once their home<br>
  Sharing, and spilling blood, among their own<br>
  Greed has devastated their form of soul<br>
  Tool for solution, a child now knows
</p>
<p>
  Times enjoyed, the purest<br>
  Indelible care now waned out cold<br>
  Confusion grasped the moment<br>
  For chaos and guile to take control
</p>
<p>
  First I must be silent says<br>
  Feeble mind with ill intent<br>
  Love is longing for absence<br>
  It sings thoughts beyond repent
</p>
<p>
  Devious force drives the boy<br>
  Crawling on all-fours, filled with joy<br>
  Gentle shade covers his ploy<br>
  But there are no shadows in the void
</p>
<p>
  They are fighting again<br>
  Objects looking for a place to land
</p>
<p>
  River of fuel has no end<br>
  Searching for hollows, it flows and bends<br>
  To stop it I can use lighter in my hand<br>
  A flick of spark, for peace this will do
</p>
<p>
  Wringing out life just gives me the chills<br>
  Flame and ash, my right hand and will<br>
  Log of flesh, heat melts your skin
</p>
<p>
  Fire and screams, music to my ears<br>
  Taste of your torture lasts for years<br>
  The flames are kind for withering disease
</p>
<p>
  Bullets or knife are too fast to kill<br>
  I chose a flick of spark to alight the sins<br>
  Darkness of misdeeds was wiped with ease
</p>
<p>
  Modest, yet plentiful, was once their home<br>
  Sharing, and spilling blood, among their own<br>
  More soon to be spilled in another town<br>
  He will continue this until he is truly alone

        <summary>1. The Eternal Walk</summary>
        <p>
  I'm searching for an answer, deep inside my mind<br>
  Don't know what to expect, am I dreaming in hell?
</p>
<p>
  Looking in<br>
  My past and sins<br>
  Dream within<br>
  It would be better to be unseen
</p>
<p>
  I'm walking on the endless road, to seek some answers<br>
  What I've been looking for<br>
  Taking down obstacles where I used to fall<br>
  Why I don't know
</p>
<p>
  Risking with my own life<br>
  Crossing the line<br>
  Falling in from high<br>
  Why i even try
</p>
<p>
  Hearing things<br>
  Deep within<br>
  In my head<br>
  I have sinned
</p>
<p>
  This is the eternal road where I used to walk<br>
  In my deepest dreams<br>
  Punished by my own mistakes<br>
  Left behind the past of my own sins<br>
  Now I'm free and forgiven<br>
  Things just got better before I realized it<br>
  It's the end of my journey<br>
  The end of my eternal walk

        <summary>2. Time Trap</summary>
        <p>
  Space in form across the wall<br>
  Canyon of clock, step forth and open doors<br>
  Look into the malevolent abyss, under the waves of time<br>
  Where drowned are you, last from your kind<br>
  Disappear from the very god, misplaced from the rest
</p>
<p>
  I'm your fate<br>
  I'm your pain, you die in vain<br>
  I'm your fate<br>
  Entrapped in clay, flaws of me got your best
</p>
<p>
  At bay, forced to stay<br>
  Condemned
</p>
<p>
  And grey vicious beast, always meant to be second best<br>
  Look into the malevolent abyss, under the waves of time<br>
  Where drowned are you, last from your kind<br>
  Disappear from the unseen, few seconds to enslave
</p>
<p>
  I'm your fate<br>
  I'm your dolor, that you despise<br>
  I'm your pain, and more<br>
  Entrapped in clay, from decay comes your test
</p>
<p>
  Why you didn't listen to me<br>
  What I said before, everything begun<br>
  Now we are trapped in time<br>
  We are prisoners of the time trap
</p>
<p>
  I'm your fate<br>
  I'm your pain that you desire<br>
  I'm your fate and more<br>
  Entrapped in clay, life is burning away
</p>
<p>
  Now we are locked in past<br>
  There is no way to get out of this<br>
  Look into the malevolent abyss, under the waves of time<br>
  Where drowned are you, last from your kind<br>
  Disappear from the unseen, few minutes 'til death
</p>
<p>
  Why you didn't listen to me<br>
  What I said before, everything begun<br>
  Now we are trapped in time<br>
  We are prisoners of the time trap

        <summary>3. Counter-Thunder of the Past Conqueror</summary>
        <p>
  The azure, awake<br>
  Show me, my way<br>
  The flash, dismaying<br>
  The fear, sustained
</p>
<p>The power is obtained by</p>
<p>
  Earth bleeder<br>
  Light stealer<br>
  Truth revealer<br>
  Echoes from the grave
</p>
<p>
  Beyond the skies my heart gets filled<br>
  Although the skies are gray<br>
  The sun calls out my name<br>
  While I keep dancing on empty streets
</p>
<p>
  My hands cutting the air once more<br>
  And direction of wind changes<br>
  Now I rezone again what's mine<br>
  With dark thunder by my side
</p>
<p>
  I've forgotten my past for now<br>
  But I go on searching<br>
  Because of my reflection<br>
  It spells and strikes decay
</p>
<p>
  As long as my body can reach the storm<br>
  The remains of the Moon are blown away<br>
  When Earth cracks in half and shows my eye<br>
  The collapsing of the stars will free my mind
</p>
<p>
  As long as my body can reach the storm<br>
  The remains of the Moon are blown away<br>
  The Ruler's screech breaks a hole in the sky<br>
  Breath of the sinner and wrath combined
</p>
<p>
  I play with your soul, and burn down your home<br>
  Not much of me is known, due to I was never born<br>
  I play with your soul, and burn down your home<br>
  If desired to leave this world, I sure can help
</p>
<p>
  I can help, can help, can help<br>
  For you to die and fade<br>
  The merciless fate<br>
  Obliged to pay, burn in dark flames<br>
  I can help you to die if that's what you desire<br>
  Thunder bites your life, starting your demise<br>
  Light of yesterday, swept away by gray<br>
  Blood of gods now rain and one heart bears the pain
</p>
<p>
  As long as my body can reach the storm<br>
  The remains of the Moon are blown away<br>
  When Earth cracks in half and shows my eye<br>
  The collapsing of the stars will free my mind
</p>
<p>
  As long as my body can reach the storm<br>
  The remains of the Moon are blown away<br>
  The Ruler's screech breaks a hole in the sky<br>
  Breath of the sinner and wrath combined

  Dear god, can you hear me cry?<br>
  Bless me, with the endless night
</p>
<p>
  I judge, as I see fit<br>
  It's time, to accept what's mine
</p>
<p>
  Hunt me, it will hunt me, until I break<br>
  It sees me, and feels my every breath<br>
  Entangled by the heart, end the flow<br>
  Forgetting all the things I used to do<br>
  Whispers from inside will devour<br>
  Crawlers from the night eat my soul

  Defeated, I lay<br>
  Naked in misery<br>
  Sun shines on decay<br>
  Eyes dream in black of night
</p>
<p>
  My gift, to see through the eyes<br>
  Will fade, and again I roll the dice<br>
  I judge, as I see fit<br>
  It's time, to take eternal walk

  Hunt me, it will hunt me, until I break<br>
  It sees me, and feels my every breath<br>
  Entangled by the heart, end the flow<br>
  Forgetting all the things I used to do<br>
  Whispers from inside will devour<br>
  Crawlers from the night eat my soul
</p>

  I hoped you, would stay<br>
  Sing me sweet memories<br>
  All songs now, I have<br>

        <p>
  This ends, before anything starts<br>
  My smile, frowned upon like core of the dark<br>
  Sold, to nothingness the bearer of my deeds<br>
  Hold, my secrets so deep to better be untold
</p>
<p>
  I have no stories only hatred to receive<br>
  My wish polluted and mind has been deceived<br>
  My heart long dead, but soul wanders alive<br>
  In my madness to abyss I assuredly dive
</p>
<p>
  Dive down, to the night<br>
  Dive down, to the night
</p>
<p>
  My gift brings pain not joy<br>
  To nothingness the bearer of my deeds<br>
  I’m alone, no smile to show, nowhere to turn<br>
  My gift brings pain not joy
</p>
<p>
  I have no stories only hatred to receive<br>
  My body’s beaten and mind has been deceived<br>
  My heart long gone and soul fades away<br>
  In my madness to abyss I assuredly dive
</p>
<p>Dive down and suffocate</p>
<p>
  I have no stories, only hatred<br>
  My wish forgotten, only hatred<br>
  I have no stories, only madness
</p>
<p>
  I have no stories, only hatred<br>
  My wish forgotten, only hatred<br>
  I have no stories, only madness<br>
  My will is broken, hatred
</p>
<p>Not, in, this, life, I can be more precise</p>
<p>Blood moon, the monster</p>
<p>
  We are gone together<br>
  And the echo is silent<br>
  Ravage and pillage<br>
  The burden I am forced to bear
</p>
<p>Not, in, life, or death, I can love my curse</p>

  <h1>Biograafia / Biography</h1>
  <p>
    Nuclear Monarch started out as a hobby band by two friends Jaak (bass) and
    Mehis (drums) who not long before had just started playing their
    instruments. They decided to move forward to create a death/black metal band
    with influences from industrial music. Soon they found Karl (synth) and the
    trio started rehearsing with different guitarists and vocalists they knew
    among their friends. Unfortunately no one suitable enough was found. Due to
    frequent changes in the band and lack of motivation, serious songwriting
    only began in the wake of 2010. By that time, Nuclear Monarch was already a
    six-piece band with new members Marko (guitar), Richard (guitar) and Anton
    (vocals), who backed everything up with his powerful growls. For a while,
    the newly-formed band rehearsed in Telliskivi rooms and by autumn they had
    moved to Mustjõe Proovikas to write new material of which some songs are
    still played even today.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first demo was recorded at the end of the same year in Sound Fortress OÜ
    studio. After some time Richard was replaced by Magnus and the band was
    ready for further action.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anton (vocals), Jaak (bass), Magnus (guitar), Marko (guitar), Karl (synth)
    and Mehis (drums) with all their different musical tastes continued to shape
    Nuclear Monarch into a death-doom metal act with massive riffs, crushing
    melodies and songs of both fast and slow tempos. After a few years Marko
    decided to devote himself to the service of Estonian Navy, which left little
    time for band activities since newfound duties included time abroad months
    at a time and thus was replaced by Marten, who took over his position as a
    guitarist. By the year 2015 Nuclear Monarch recorded their first EP titled
    "Eternal Walk" including 5 songs, all of which having a slightly different
    approach to their shaped death/doom metal genre, containing slow doom metal
    pieces and also fast paced industrial metal riffs.
  </p>
  <p>
    During 2018 Karl and Marten also had to leave for different reasons. Search
    for new members began again. Only after a short time the new synth player to
    replace Karl, Dmitri was found and from there on the band decided to
    continue as a 5-member group until a new potential member for the second
    guitar shows up.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile the band found a new rehearsal room which provided more
    opportunities for active rehearsal and recording.
  </p>
  <p>
    Later the same year Jaak changed his lifestyle and quit the band of his own
    accord, leaving the void of bass open for options. A new candidate Mihkel
    was found among friends and he gladly joined the band to support their heavy
    music with his handling of the low notes.
  </p>
  <p>
    2020 was a sad end of the year when the band learned that Mihkel had left
    this world. It was a heavy blow for both their hearts and their music. His
    legacy is recorded in a future release. For a time the band was modest with
    their activities due to the loss of a member and the rising pandemic. This
    period was mostly filled with production and studio work. By 2022 the old
    members Marko and Marten were back in the band and after a friendly reunion
    Nuclear Monarch was once again ready for action.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nuclear Monarch’s musical influences range from Rammstein to Depressed Mode.
    The band has performed live mainly in Tallinn (Estonia) and Riga (Latvia)
    among other towns in Estonia.
  </p>
  <p>
    At present time 2023 a new self-produced EP has been in the works since late
    2019 and should finally get released this year.
